## Overview
This project implements a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to simulate disaster response scenarios like earthquakes, floods, and wildfires. Built with Python and Streamlit, it features autonomous agents such as Controller, Rescue, and Drone. The system uses a Groq cloud with  `Deepseek R1 Distill Llama 70B` model for agent decision-making, dynamically assigning tasks such as victim rescue, supply delivery, damage assessment, and route clearing.

The `DisasterEnvironment` class generates and updates a 100x100 grid with affected areas, blocked routes, and victim locations, while `simulation.py` manages the workflow, including random agent failures (10% chance) and battery depletion. The Streamlit UI visualizes agent statuses, a mission flowchart, and chat logs while logging results to a CSV knowledge base for future use.

## Workflow  

The system operates as a coordinated workflow involving multiple agents and components.  

- Initialization  
    - The `DisasterEnvironment` generates a random disaster scenario (earthquake, flood, or wildfire) with affected areas, blocked routes, victim locations, and supply needs. 
    - Agents are instantiated with specific roles and capabilities via `get_agents()`.  

- Simulation Loop (`run_disaster_simulation`)  
    - The environment updates dynamically (e.g., wildfires spread, floods shift blockages).  
    - Agents perform tasks assigned by the Controller, with a 10% chance of random failure to simulate real-world unpredictability.  
    - Tasks are logged in a chat log, agent statuses are tracked, and a flowchart visualizes the mission flow.  

- Agent Coordination  
    - The Controller assigns tasks based on environmental data.  
    - Agents execute tasks, communicate results, and update their status (e.g., battery levels, location).  

- UI Rendering (`chat_ui.py`)  
    - A Streamlit interface displays agent statuses, mission flow (flowchart), and chat logs in real-time.  
    - The simulation auto-refreshes during execution and saves results to a knowledge base (`disaster_knowledge_base.csv`).  

- Completion  
    - The simulation ends after a set number of steps or when tasks are resolved, displaying a success message.  


## Agent Types & Details  

The agents operate in a hierarchical structure with the Controller as the central hub. 
- **Controller**: Acts as the orchestrator, assigning tasks to all other agents based on the disaster environmentâ€™s state. 
- **Other Agents** (Rescue-1, Drone-1, Medical-1, Assess-1, Supplies-1, Routes-1): These are task executors that receive instructions from the Controller and report back their results. They donâ€™t directly communicate with each other; all communication flows through the Controller.
- **Backup Agents** (Drone-2, Supplies-2): These are activated only if their primary counterparts (Drone-1, Supplies-1) fail due to battery depletion or random failure. They inherit the same role and relationship with the Controller.

### Total Agents  
There are a total of 9 agents, with 7 active at initialization and 2 backup agents available if needed.  

- **Active Agents:** 7  
- **Backup Agents:** 2 (*Drone-2* and *Supplies-2*)  

### Agent Specifications

   - Name: <mark>Controller</mark>  

2. **Rescue Agent**  
   - Role: Extracts victims from disaster zones and provides first aid.  
   - Capabilities: Victim extraction, first aid.  
   - Name: <mark>Rescue-1</mark>  

3. **Drone Agents**  
   - Role: Surveys hard-to-reach areas and detects victims.  
   - Capabilities: Surveillance, victim detection.  
   - Name: <mark>Drone-1,</mark> <mark>Drone-2</mark>  

4. **Medical Agent**  
   - Role: Treats injured victims and coordinates transport.  
   - Capabilities: Treatment, transport.  
   - Name: <mark>Medical-1</mark>  

5. **Assess Agent**  
   - Role: Analyzes structural damage and detects hazards.  
   - Capabilities: Structural analysis, hazard detection.  
   - Name: <mark>Assess-1</mark>  

6. **Supplies Agents**  
   - Role: Delivers essential supplies (food, water, medical).  
   - Capabilities: Food, water, medical supply delivery.  
   - Name: <mark>Supplies-1,</mark> <mark>Supplies-2</mark>  

7. **Routes Agent**  
   - Role: Plans and clears evacuation routes.  
   - Capabilities: Route planning, barricade management.  
   - Name: <mark>Routes-1</mark>  

 

#### Relationship Summary

- One-to-Many: Controller â†’ All other agents (uni-directional task assignment).  
- Feedback Loop: Agents â†’ Controller (report task completion or status).  
- No Peer-to-Peer: Agents donâ€™t interact directly with each other.  

#### Order of Controller Communication
The Controller communicates with each agent sequentially in this order within each simulation step.
- If an agent is inactive (e.g., due to failure or battery depletion), its task is skipped or delegated to a backup (for Drone-1 and Supplies-1).
- The order reflects a logical progression; planning (Controller), infrastructure (Routes-1), reconnaissance (Drone-1), assessment (Assess-1), and then action (Rescue-1, Supplies-1, Medical-1).

Note: The Controllerâ€™s communication order is fixed, but task execution depends on the environment (e.g., Rescue-1 and Medical-1 only act if victims exist).

## Future Enhancements

1. Redesign the Controller to execute agent tasks in parallel using threads/asyncio.
2. Implement direct agent-to-agent communication beyond the Controller (P2P).
3. Add more disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, tsunamis) with unique dynamics.
4. Enhance the UI with interactive controls like pause or step-through simulation.
5. Integrate human-in-the-loop for dynamic decision-making.

**Note:** In the current implementation, Medical-1 depends on prior steps (Routes-1, Drone-1/2, Assess-1, Rescue-1) to ensure victims are reachable and resources are used efficiently. Acting first risks wasting resources on inaccessible areas. The sequence ensures optimal resource allocation, validates victim presence, and avoids chaotic responses by stabilizing the situation before medical intervention. This approach can be changed according to the required priority.
